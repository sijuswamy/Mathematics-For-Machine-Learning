    "2. Rui obtained a random sample of colleagues at work and noticed a positive linear relationship between their ages and the number of kilometers they said they walked yesterday. A 95%, percent confidence interval for the slope of the regression line was (15.4, 155.2). Rui wants to use this interval to test $H_0: \\beta=0$ vs. $H_1: \\beta \\neq 0$ at the 5% level of significance. Assume that all conditions for inference have been met. What should Rui conclude?"
